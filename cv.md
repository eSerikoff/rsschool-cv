### Briefly about myself
Before getting into IT, I worked in completely different jobs. For almost 10 years I was a telecommunications engineer, after that I was a truck driver, then a courier, and after that I went from a salesperson to a content manager in a construction hypermarket. After all this, I finally got into IT as a manual tester, which is what I currently work as.  
However, I always liked writing code myself. I also like to see the results of my work immediately and quickly. That is why I decided to establish the profession of a front-end developer.

### Code example
**KATA from Codewars:** The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where each character in the new string is "(" if that character appears only once in the original string, or ")" if that character appears more than once in the original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.

```
function duplicateEncode(word){

  const arrStr = word.toLowerCase().split('');
  let newStr = '';

  for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i++){
    if ([...arrStr].filter(x => x === word[i].toLowerCase()).length > 1) {
      newStr += ")";  
      } else {
        newStr += '(';
      }    
  }
    return newStr;
}
```
