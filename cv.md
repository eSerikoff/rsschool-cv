### Briefly about myself
Before getting into IT, I worked in completely different jobs. For almost 10 years I was a telecommunications engineer, after that I was a truck driver, then a courier, and after that I went from a salesperson to a content manager in a construction hypermarket. After all this, I finally got into IT as a manual tester, which is what I currently work as.  
However, I always liked writing code myself. I also like to see the results of my work immediately and quickly. That is why I decided to establish the profession of a front-end developer.
